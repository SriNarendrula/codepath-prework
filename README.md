**Broject** is an app that shows what my name, universtiy name, and aspirational job is. The main feature is a button that says "Color Change?" and changes the background color randomly when pressed. 

Time spent: **2 1/2** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Spotify

- Curated playlists and recommendations

Google Maps
- Real-time traffic updates
- Offline maps

Reddit
- Topic-based communities (subreddits)
- Voting system for ranking content

App Idea: My idea is a homework checklist app called Homework Hero. It would have reminders and progress tracking making it easy to manage tasks and deadlines effectively. The app allows users to organize tasks by subject, priority, or due date and set custom reminders for upcoming deadlines. Users can track their progress with visual indicators, create recurring assignments for weekly or daily tasks, and even work offline to access and update checklists without an internet connection. Homework Hero also includes collaboration tools, enabling students to share task lists with classmates or group members. With calendar integration, tasks can sync seamlessly with Google Calendar or other calendar apps. Users can also attach images, links, or files to assignments for quick access to resources. This app aims to provide a straightforward and effective solution for managing homework and academic tasks, empowering students to stay organized and productive.

## Notes

The challenges I had mostly involved familiarizing myself with the xcode interface. I also inserted the changeColor function before the changeBackgroundColor function and that stopped me for like 5-10 minutes.
